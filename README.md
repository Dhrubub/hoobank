# Hoobank

Hoobank is a hypothetical modern banking website.
The website was created using ReactJS and Tailwind following the UI/UX provided by this [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/bUGIPys15E78w9bs1l4tgS/HooBank?type=design&node-id=310-485&t=ayMgmjhem3JPlZfP-0).

This was built by following a tutorial by [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery). The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oO4Qi5aVZs&t=4009s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery).

I took on this tutorial to build my frontend skills in ReactJS and Tailwind to create modern applications.
